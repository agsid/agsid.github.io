                <p class="mb-4">
                    FIRST LEGO League (FLL) is a global robotics competition that introduces young people to the exciting world of STEM through hands-on learning. Teams typically aged 9-16 (ages may vary by region) work together to design, build, and program LEGO robots to complete a series of missions on a themed playing field.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    But FLL is much more than just robots! It also challenges teams to identify a real-world problem related to the annual theme and develop an innovative solution, which they present to a panel of judges. Through this process, participants develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and presentation skills, all while embodying FLL's core values like teamwork and gracious professionalism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's an incredible opportunity for students to explore science and technology in a fun, competitive, and supportive environment, preparing them for future success in a rapidly evolving world.

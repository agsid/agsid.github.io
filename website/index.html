        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4 text-center">What is FIRST LEGO League (FLL)?</h2>
        <p class="text-white text-lg mb-4">
            FIRST LEGO League (FLL) is a global robotics competition that introduces young people to the exciting world of STEM through hands-on learning. Teams typically aged 9-16 (ages may vary by region) work together to design, build, and program LEGO robots to complete a series of missions on a themed playing field.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg">
            But FLL is much more than just robots! It also challenges teams to identify a real-world problem related to the annual theme and develop an innovative solution, which they present to a panel of judges. Through this process, participants develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and presentation skills, all while embodying FLL's core values like teamwork and gracious professionalism.
            It's an incredible opportunity for students to explore science and technology in a fun, competitive, and supportive environment, preparing them for future success in a rapidly evolving world.

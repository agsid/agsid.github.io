        <p class="mb-4 text-black">
          FIRST LEGO League (FLL) is a global robotics competition that introduces young people to the exciting
          world of STEM through hands-on learning. Teams of 5th to 8th graders work together to design, build,
          and program LEGO robots to complete a series of missions on a themed playing field set by the FLL committee.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-black">
          But FLL is much more than just robots! It challenges teams to identify a real-world problem related to
          the annual theme and develop an innovative solution, which they present to a panel of judges. Through
          this process, participants develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and presentation skills — all while
          embodying FLL's core values like teamwork and Gracious Professionalism.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black">
          It's an incredible opportunity for students to explore science and technology in a fun, competitive, and
          supportive environment — preparing them for future success in a rapidly evolving world.
